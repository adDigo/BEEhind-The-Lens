# BEEhind-The-Lens
BEEhind The Lens is a photography business that provides service for family, newborn + maternity, events, the NICU, and more. The current BEEhind The Lens Website (link provided below) was created using a website template. Feeling limited with what this web host provides, this photographer wanted to go beyond the "drag and drop" limitations, add more functionality, and have it re-designed it in such a way that best represents her business. This project aims to re-create this website by re-desinging it in such a way that caters to the needs of this photographer; achieving the ideal website in order for her business to flourish.
